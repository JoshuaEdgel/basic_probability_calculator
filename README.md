# basic_probability_calculator
Basic probability calculator I made in c++. It doesn't have a gui all command line. The formulas that it can do are coin probability, choose, binomial probability density function, binomial probability cumulative distribution function, and reverse binomial probability cumulative distribution function.
There is also a way to look at all the different formulas inside of the program.
